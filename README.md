# ConsultIum
A project made for consult firms to be able to keep track of their consultants, what you charge the client, etc.

Current technology:
* C#, .NET 7, Entity Framework with SQLite as DB for now.

## What will it be able to do?:
* Each consultant will be able to have their own profile, where they can have a profile picture, resum√©, skills, previous assignments, current assignment, hourly rate etc.

* An admin portal where an admin / the owner can view all consultant and filter them depending on skills, rate, on/off-assignment.

* A login system, maybe implement Oauth?


## Thoughts for future
- Might replicate it in Rust in the future.
- Build a FrontEnd?
- Cloud Hosting?
